# 👋 Hi, I'm Olaide

I am a **hands-on software engineer** with a love for building systems that are intuitive, scalable, and maintainable. While I specialize in **Python**, **Django**, and **backend engineering**, I work comfortably across the stack, from frontend interfaces to cloud deployment pipelines.

I have worked in **collaborative teams**, contributed to cross-functional projects, and led efforts that required both architectural planning and low-level debugging. Whether it's setting up CI/CD, writing tests, improving API performance, or helping a teammate debug an issue, I care about delivering clean, efficient solutions.

Technologies I have used in real-world, team-based projects:

* 🐍 **Backend**: Python, Django, Rust, FastAPI
* 🌐 **Frontend**: JavaScript (ES6+), React, HTML5, CSS3
* 💾 **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB
* ☁️ **Cloud & Hosting**: AWS (Lambda, S3, SES, EC2, IAM), Nginx, Gunicorn, Apache
* ⚙️ **DevOps**: Git, GitHub Actions, Shell scripting, CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes
* 🧪 **Testing**: Pytest, Selenium, Playwright, Postman, Django Test Client
* 📊 **Data**: SQL, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter
* 📚 **Currently Learning**:

  * Clean Code, Modular and Reusable Design, and Pragmatic Development Practices
  * Node.js
  * DevOps automation workflows
  * French 🇫🇷 (Bonjour! J'apprend sur Duolingo tous les jour 😄)

## 👥 Collaboration Highlights

* 🤝 Worked with **agile teams** to deliver features across sprints, write user stories, and participate in code reviews.
* 🤝 Built and maintained **RESTful APIs**, collaborated with frontend devs for seamless integrations.
* 🤝 Set up CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tooling to improve deployment reliability and team productivity.
* 🤝 Mentored junior developers and self-taught learners, creating documentation and walkthroughs to support onboarding.
* 🤝 Contributed to team retrospectives and architectural discussions, balancing practicality with scalability.

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

* 🧠 I **build to understand**, not just to finish. I dig into how tools work under the hood.
* 💬 I **communicate clearly**, whether it’s technical documentation, async updates, or mentoring.
* 🔁 I am comfortable in **both solo and team settings**, taking ownership or supporting where needed.
* 🧰 I value **clean code**, readable tests, and maintainable architecture.
* 🌱 I am always learning, and I enjoy sharing what I learn with others.

## 🔍 What I am Looking For

I'm actively seeking **engineering roles**, backend, fullstack, or DevOps, where I can:

* Contribute to real-world systems and team-driven projects
* Grow under experienced engineers and also mentor junior devs
* Help deliver great user experiences and scalable backends

If you’re looking for someone who’s:

* Focused and fast-learning
* Solid in backend development
